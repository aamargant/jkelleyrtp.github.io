+++

Originally from North Carolina, I am now a greater-Bostonian with eyes set on the west coast. Though I brand myself as a Systems Engineer with a passion for entrepreneurship, I am actually persuing a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) with emphasis on product design and business skills. I earned my SolidWorks CSWP in high school and spent a few summers working in machine shops, so I'm very fluent in the mechanical, software, firmware, and electrical domains with a slight eege in software.

Today, I am studying at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering - the smallest and smartest engineering college you've never heard of. Olin refuses to teach to the test and all our classes are filled with group work, projects, and solving actual problems in the real world. Make sure to stop by sometime and check out Olin expo - you'll find me presenting some various project ranging from a nuclear fusion reactor to new algorithms for augmented reality.

When not slinging code, machining parts, or CAD-ing, you can find me obsessing over startup world. I live, breathe, sleep startups and am deeply engaged with Boston and San Francisco's hardware startup scene. Small teams and big problems pave the way for innovation and I'm on a mission to make sure the world 20 years from now looks nothing like that of today.
