For my final project in my Principles of Engineering course, I helped design, build, and program a "shadow boxing" robot.

The robot, inspired by the early 2010s movie Real Steel, used an XBox Kinect to analyze a human player's movements and "fight back," throwing punches, bobbing, and weaving. It supported 8 degrees of freedom, inverse kinematics, and an skeletal tracking algorithm written in concurrent Python.

A technical blog of the project is available here: __[Real Steel](http://poe.olin.edu/2019/realsteel/)__
