For my final project in Partial Differential Equations, I solved Schroedinger's wave equation for electron densities around the hydrogen atom.

This particular project showcases deep mathematical understanding of multivariable calculus and partial differential equations.

A brief overview of the paper is available here: __[From PDE to Picture](https://jonathankelley.notion.site/The-Hydrogen-Atom-From-PDE-to-Picture-3b19448c67c740c78fa23edb7988ea5a)__
