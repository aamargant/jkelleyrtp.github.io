I won world finalist in the High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Among the models my team developed, I am most proud of our novel approach to solving a swarm-based approach to autonomous drone navigation.

We implemented a swarm navigation algorithm for use in the Intel Shooting Star drone light show. This particular algorithm implemented A* in 3d dimensions with an additional a fourth dimension: time.

This particular algorithm maximized drone performance, transition speed, and beauty.
