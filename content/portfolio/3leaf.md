I co-founded a small company that built position tracking firmware and software for industrial automation using ultrawideband technology.

Our project collected many accolades including finalist for MITâ€™s Lemelson Student Prize, finalist for the MIT 100K Pitch competition, semifinalist for MIT 100K Accelerate, and acceptance into the MIT Fuse incubator program. In addition, we won the Conrad Spirit of Innovation Challenge and secured provisional patent and patent rights for our tracking technology.

We raised nearly $20,000 through various pitch competitions and grant programs. For the company, I lead the technology development efforts: designing custom circuit boards, implementing a novel form of positioning (collaborative multilateration), and writing large portions of the firmware and cloud software stack in Python and Rust.
