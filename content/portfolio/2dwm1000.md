I developed a new UI library for Rust that follows in the footsteps of React. It supports rendering on many platforms: web, desktop, mobile, TUI, LiveView, and more.

The library has gained over 3000⭐️ GitHub stars in under 2 months and has an active Discord community of over 300 members.

Dioxus showcases my talents in writing low-level Rust code with manual memory management.

**Skills**: custom futures, custom memory allocators, self-referential data-structures, procedural macros, and WebAssembly.
