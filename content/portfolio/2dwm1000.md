I maintain the high-level and low-level API for the DecaWave ultrawideband radio in Rust. The library has over 30 Github stars and is used in production for my work at Leaf Systems as well as use in various community/hobbyist projects.

Some of my additions to the crate include a variety of distance correction algorithms, performance improvements, and bug fixing.

This particular project targets embedded Rust with `no_std` and very low-level IO.
