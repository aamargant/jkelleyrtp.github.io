Hello there!

I am a Franklin W. Olin College systems engineering student and business enthusiast. Originally from North Carolina, I have somehow ended up in the cold suburbs of the northeast in one of the most interesting colleges in the world. With only about 360 students and 3 degrees, Olin is one of the few places in the US where your days can be filled with designing microprocessors, machining a fusion reactor, running a startup incubator, and unicycling through the campus center all while running a baked goods business out of your room.

No, seriously, this was my day today.

When not doing whacky, project based learning, I enjoy the outdoors (who doesn't?) and spend way too much money on bubble tea.

Over the years, my interests have shifted around from robotics to particle physics to augmented reality and now to startups. As a result, I've worked in nuclear labs, machine shops, product development firms, 

I am particularly excited about the intersection of data and business
